Algorithmic
===========

algorithms I feel like implementing in different languages for fun

in any clojure projects the code will be found in the projectname/src/projectname/core and other files
(run with lein run)

ruby files here can be run with a basic "Ruby filename",
any inputs needed will be coded into the projects by default (but be ready to accept args!)
